I keep on getting the following error if I don't export helper methods:

=ERROR REPORT==== 4-Aug-2015::12:30:06 ===
Error in process <0.4933.4> with exit value:
{undef,[{ring,loop,[<0.4405.4>],[]}]}

Why do i have to export all functions in my module? Can the helper functions not be exported?


s - > starts a new shell
j -> jobs running in the shell
c -> connect
